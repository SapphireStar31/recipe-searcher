# Recipe Searcher
## Problem Statement:
Being an adult means making dinner, but perhaps you aren't sure of what you can make with the ingredients you have in the house or just want some ideas of what to try making next. Being able to head to one site and see what recipes use your ingredients because eggs were on sale, and now you have 5 dozen waiting to be used would be great. When searching on Google you see multitudes of different recipes that may all just scrambled eggs with different people posting the recipe instead of getting scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, French toast and actual different recipes you never thought of that use eggs.

I hope to make a site that solves this problem by being able to list a recipe and what ingredients are commonly put in it. Users are then able to search for recipes that use a specific ingredient. Users will also be able to browse through all the recipes and click on ones they want to try making and find the list of ingredients as well.

## Goal:
Creating an easy to navigate site that holds different recipes with their common ingredients so users can have help using ingredients or finding the next thing to make.
